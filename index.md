### Demand Forecasting

This study is done to figure out the factors that influence the demand for the boombikes bike-sharing company. We are going to build a model that would predict the demand as accurately as possible from the pre-pandemic dataset. The predictions derived from the given features will be used by the management to understand market dynamics and strategize the business plans accordingly, to be the preferred bike-share company.

Our approach to solving the problem would be to build a model with the given features and predict the target (count of total rental bikes including both casual and registered), reliably. For this we would first understand the data, prepare the data, do the EDA. Then build a model with trainig data, evaluate it with test data.

This is just a collection of topics and algorithms that in my opinion are interesting.

It contains several topics that are not so popular nowadays, but that can be very powerful. Usually, topics such as PDE methods, LÃ©vy processes, Fourier methods or Kalman filter are not very popular among practitioners, who prefers to work with more standard tools.
The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.

### Gesture Recognizer

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/sajankedia/CNNGestureRecognizer)

Gesture recognition via CNN neural network implemented in Keras + Theano + OpenCV

Key Requirements: Python 3.6.1 OpenCV 3.4.1 Keras 2.0.2 Tensorflow 1.2.1 Theano 0.9.0 (obsolete and not supported any further)

Suggestion: Better to download Anaconda as it will take care of most of the other packages and easier to setup a virtual workspace to work with multiple versions of key packages like python, opencv etc.
